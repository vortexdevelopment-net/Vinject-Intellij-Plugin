# VInject IntelliJ Plugin

## Description

The VInject IntelliJ Plugin enhances your development experience by adding syntax highlighting and helpful tips for the VInject framework. This plugin makes it easier to work with VInject by providing visual cues and contextual information directly within the IntelliJ IDE.

## Project Wizard

The plugin includes a project wizard that helps you quickly set up a new VInject project. The wizard guides you through the necessary steps and configurations, ensuring that your project is correctly set up with all the required dependencies and settings.

## Component Creation Using File Templates

To streamline the development process, the plugin provides file templates for creating new VInject components. These templates can be accessed from the 'New' menu within the IntelliJ IDE. By using these templates, you can quickly generate boilerplate code for new components, ensuring consistency and reducing the amount of manual coding required.

To add these file templates to your project, place them in the project's `resources/vinject/templates` folder. See [VortexCore templates](https://github.com/vortexdevelopment-net/Vinject-Intellij-Plugin/tree/master/src/main/resources/fileTemplates). The plugin will automatically recognize and use these templates when creating new components.
